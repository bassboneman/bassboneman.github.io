        <h3>I Already Have A WHBM Rewards Number But Am Creating An Account Online For The First Time. Do I Need My WHBM Rewards Number To Register?</h3>
        <p>If you are new to whbm.com but have already received a WHBM Rewards member number by shopping in our boutiques, outlets, or by phone, there will be a field in the online Registration page where you can enter your WHBM Rewards number. This allows us to locate you in our records and ensure that you receive your WHBM Rewards benefits as you shop online. You can find your WHBM Rewards member number on the back of your WHBM catalog or on your receipt.</p>
        <p>If you are already a registered user on whbm.com and are logged-in to the site, you will automatically receive your WHBM Rewards benefits. In this case you will not need to enter your WHBM Rewards member number.</p>
        <h3>The Website Gave Me A Different WHBM Rewards Number. What Do I Do Now?</h3>
        <p>If you already have a WHBM Rewards number and did not enter it when you created an account online, the number you see is a new WHBM Rewards number. Both numbers should merge within 72 hours and your original number is the one that will remain active. Any purchasing you do on the temporary number will be transferred to your original account once merged. In the meantime, if there should be any interference with your discounts and benefits, just contact us at 877.948.2525 or <a href="mailto:customerservice@whitehouseblackmarket.com">customerservice@whitehouseblackmarket.com</a> with your order information and we will make the adjustments for you. If you have achieved Silver status (total qualifying net spend in a calendar year is equal to or greater than $500) and your order does not reflect your member discounts, please contact us with your order information and we will make the adjustments for you.</p>
        <h3>I Received Communication Telling Me I'm A Silver Member, But I Know I've Spent Enough To Qualify Me For A Higher Tier. What Should I Do?</h3>
        <p>You may have two or more account numbers on file that should be merged to combine all your purchases into a single account and qualify you for a higher tier. Please contact us at 877.948.2525 or <a href="whbm.com/signin">whbm.com/signin</a> or register your account online at <a href="//www.whbm.com">whbm.com</a></p>
        <h3>If I Was A Black Book Member, Will I Be Automatically Enrolled In WHBM Rewards?</h3>
        <p>Yes. All Black Book members will be automatically enrolled in WHBM Rewards at Welcome, Silver, Gold or Platinum status, depending on your total net qualifying purchases over the prior calendar year. Plus, you'll continue to receive your offers. To check your status, sign in to your account at <a href="//www.whbm.com/signin">whbm.com/signin</a> or register your account online at <a href="//www.whbm.com/register">whbm.com</a>.</p>
        <h3>What Are The Benefits Of Becoming A WHBM Rewards Member?</h3>

Once you achieve Silver status (total net spend in a calendar year is equal to or greater than $500), you'll receive 5% off all future purchases for life!</p>
        <h3>What Are The Requirements And Benefits Of Each Tier?</h3>
        <p>Currently there are four tiers of benefits in the WHBM Rewards program. They are determined by net purchases made at White House Black Market (boutiques and outlets, online at whbm.com or by phone) during the calendar year. The four tiers are: Welcome, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Upon joining WHBM Rewards, you will be automatically enrolled as a member of the Welcome tier. Learn more at <a href="whbm.com/rewards">whbm.com/rewards</a>.</p>
        <h3>If I Qualify For Platinum Status And Then Return Items, Will I Drop To Gold Status?</h3>
        <p>You will move up in status during the calendar year based on your net purchases (total purchases less returns) in the calendar year. You will not move to lower tiers during the calendar year if you return items. However, when we look at your total net purchases in January, if you did not have at least $2,000 in qualifying net purchases during the prior year you will drop to the tier reflective of how much you spent.</p>
        <h3>How Long Will I Maintain My Tier Status?</h3>
        <p>As soon as you qualify for a new tier, you will receive an email welcoming you to that tier. You will maintain that status for the remainder of the current calendar year and the following year. While you won't drop tiers in the current calendar year, any returns you make may affect your tier status for the following year as calculated in January.</p>
        <h3>How Long Will It Take For A Purchase To Be Added To My Qualifying Spend?</h3>
        <p>Please allow three business days for your purchase to be reflected in your total qualifying net spend.</p>
        <h3>I Signed In To Check My Account, But The Website Does Not Accurately Reflect My Status. What Should I Do?</h3>
