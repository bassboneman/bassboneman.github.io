The diagnosis came just a month after getting engaged. She was well aware of what the future might hold for her, as her mother was diagnosed with the same stage of breast cancer in October of 2010. She became determined in her resolve to not allow breast cancer to define her future.</p><p>“At every step you realize there are two doors—I can be happy and take control of my life—because cancer can do a lot of things to me, right? But my happiness, my joy, the things that make me fulfilled—like my relationships—all can’t be tarnished by that.” It’s an attitude that keeps her grounded in the joys of the everyday, and pushes her forward with an inextinguishable spirit. “We’re conditioned to think that everything is wrong…the news is awful, everything is bad…but you still have choices. You can still be happy. There’s so much to be grateful for.”</p><p>Her bright outlook continues to lead her to happiness…Ayanna and her then fiancé purchased their first home and got married Labor Day weekend, 2014. Years later, he continues to be her “superhero.”</p><p>Ayanna connected with Living Beyond Breast Cancer soon after being diagnosed. Her first experience speaking at the annual Metastatic Breast Cancer Conference was “a life-changing one.” Ayanna has since shared her story of living with MBC by contributing to LBBC blogs and acting as a patient advocate.</p><p>Ayanna has been a member of the LBBC Board of Directors since 2014.</p>' %}

Thirty eight and without a significant family history of breast cancer, she monitored the lump, hoping it would disappear as mysteriously as it had appeared. She asked her GYN to examine the area during a routine yearly appointment. She recommended it be evaluated with an ultrasound and mammogram. An area of concern was discovered, and she was referred to a surgeon who biopsied the area on Halloween. Trick or treating with her three children that evening: Quinn 8, Fiona 5, and Liam 2, she thought "soon this will be behind me." Two days later, she learned she had invasive breast cancer.</p><p>Subsequent testing revealed that another area in the same breast was concerning for DCIS.  Unilateral mastectomy and reconstruction with a tissue expander was recommended.  Her tumor was ER/PR positive, and following surgery, she started on a ten year course of hormonal therapy with Tamoxifen.</p><p>In the spirit of LBBC and determined to "live beyond her cancer," she returned to work two weeks after the mastectomy. An internal medicine physician who cares for patients in the hospital and supervises medical students and residents, she found that the time at work helped her to move forward and that the experience of being a patient deepened her own practice of medicine. She is grateful for the tremendous support from colleagues, friends and especially her family.</p><p>One month following her final reconstructive procedure, she and her husband ran the 10-mile broad street run in Philadelphia.  Running has helped her to stay physically and emotionally grounded during the experience.</p>' %}

She’s been married to her husband, who she describes as “fantastic,” since 1989. She is the Executive Director of a nonprofit that provides opportunities for individuals of diverse backgrounds to come together in educational and recreational activities.</p><p>Judy was diagnosed with triple positive breast cancer at age 48, a week before she and her husband were to leave for Italy to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. After getting preliminary testing done in a week, every medical professional she encountered said “GO on your vacation!” After 10 “glorious” days in Venice and Tuscany, she returned to face the next year and half of grueling treatment.</p><p>Upon meeting her oncologist, she was told that because of her particular type of cancer and tumor size, she was eligible to participate in a clinical trial. This meant that part of her treatment would be a drug being studied and not routinely used (or even approved by the FDA). After much deliberation and discussion with both her doctor and LBBC, she made the tough decision to take part in the trial.</p><p>She was monitored closely and discovered that after her very first chemo treatment on the trial drug, her tumor was almost gone. It gave her hope and resolve.</p><p>Though Judy’s treatment ended four months ago, lingering side effects have left her feeling as if she’s not yet “finished.” She is looking forward to the time where she can “get through a day without thinking about breast cancer.”</p>' %}

Over the next year, she underwent a bilateral mastectomy, reconstructive surgery and a grueling regimen of chemotherapy.</p><p>“It came in waves, both buoyant and exasperating,” she says. Her wedding was celebrated a year after the original date. She got back to work. Slowly, she began to build her self-esteem, which felt “damaged from her experience”. In lieu of nipple reconstruction, she decided to make a statement with a Tree of Life tattoo she designed. As she began to heal and reclaim her body, she was met with a hurdle she simply did not see coming: her lingerie drawer.</p><p>She was told by doctors she would never be able to wear traditional lingerie again; conventional bras or items with bra cups would not fit her body properly. Annoyed, slightly devastated and incredibly frustrated by the lack of options, Dana did what she had been doing for the past year. She got motivated and took control and created AnaOno, a line of lingerie designed specifically to address the needs of women impacted by breast cancer.</p><p>Dana is the epitome of the AnaOno woman. Strong, beautiful, sexy, courageous, determined, grateful and excited for life. She will never stop until she instills these qualities in those she meets through her various charitable contributions, breast cancer events and customer base. As Dana says, “with AnaOno, you are never alone.”</p>' %}
