In general:
DONE: on mobile, clicking the "credit card" radio should scroll the credit section offset from the top of the modal.
DONE: "SELECT A SHIPPING ADDRESS" modal for registered users, need a "ship to multiple addresses" button.
* This button will close the modal and completely change the page. See below for next steps.

* On multiship, if she clicks the button with her address (or the button with add a new address), then she should get the modal from "Order review with multi-ship" button. That modal should not be triggered in the "Order review with multi-ship" spot. Basically, remove the modal from "Change Shipping Options".

Flow 2:
DONE: She's only gifting 1 item.
DONE: Gift package individually: remove the gifted item and just have 2 generic items (with correct images and colors).
DONE: On same form, clicking save will toggle the gifted item instead and hide the checkbox item.
DONE: Add a green checkbox to the gifted state item.
* Add gifting to confirmation with change/remove links removed from the template. Keep the toggle.


Flow 3:
* 3 items.
* See above about button.
DONE: Page reloads with "Choose Where to Ship Each Item" as the lead element.
DONE: The sections no longer have numbers.
DONE: After initial ship each item container, the order will be:
DONE: ** payment/giftcard
DONE: ** order total with promotion code

DONE: Clicking the address buttons (Liz Hamilton) will launch the modal with the address book. She'll select a different address. Close the modal onto page 2.
DONE: Page 2 can not have the place order button. hide it entirely.

DONE: Third page trigger: Save & Continue button in "Choose Where to Ship Each Item" block will load page 3.

Page 3
DONE: Next page will include this from the template index: "Order review with multi-ship"
DONE: Disable first button in that block.
DONE: After that, include the payment block and the order summary block with "Place Order" button


MODALS:
* #modal-address-multi will show up on multi-ship if she clicks the button next to the product that says "Add a New Address"

* #modal-address-multi-select
** Add a new heading above the form reveal that says "Add a New Address"
** Add the shipping option radios if it is a multi-ship modal





==================================

Gift message should always be blue
Make sure it says Gift Message only or "Gift Wrap - $6.00"

ON this page:
http://localhost:5000/soma/pages/checkout/flows/3/checkout-2.html

When she clicks the address button, she'll enter a new address for the first item. On save, update the first item in the list with a new address. That new address needs to carry over to confirmation. (No. 14 in the doc.)


ON multi-ship review, add payment and order summary to the bottom, just beneath the gifting bar.









===================================
DONE: Add modal header background to modal footer to make it stand out more
DONE: Mobile modal buttons will have 1.5rem left/right padding
DONE: Look at the product-details dl's to see about saving space
DONE: Remove change | remove from gifting modals
DONE: .edit-remove needs to flush right on mobile (remove 767px media query)




Modals:
Fix resize bug
Fix footer double click bug
Abbreviate modal headings when too long for mobile <span class="hidden-xs">

Order Summary:
Need Place Order button beneath promo code in both dropdown and sidebar
FLow 1 needs a disabled button until she clicks Save & Continue in payment block
